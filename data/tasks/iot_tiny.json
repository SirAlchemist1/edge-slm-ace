    "question": "What is the anomaly threshold for temperature sensor readings?",
    "context": "A temperature sensor reports readings every minute. Normal range is 20-25°C. Readings above 30°C or below 15°C are considered anomalies.",
    "answer": "30"

    "question": "What action should be taken when motion sensor detects activity during off-hours?",
    "context": "Motion sensors are active 24/7. During business hours (9 AM - 5 PM), activity is normal. Outside these hours, activity triggers an alert.",
    "answer": "alert"
  },

    "id": "iot_3",
    "domain": "iot",
    "question": "What is the recommended sampling rate for humidity sensors?",
    "context": "Humidity sensors should be sampled every 5 minutes to detect rapid changes. Battery-powered sensors can sample every 15 minutes to conserve energy.",
    "answer": "5 minutes"
  },

    "question": "What is the maximum acceptable latency for door sensor alerts?",
    "context": "Door sensors must report state changes within 2 seconds to ensure security. Network latency should not exceed 500ms.",
    "answer": "2 seconds"
  },

    "question": "What battery level triggers a low-power warning for IoT devices?",
    "context": "IoT devices operate normally above 20% battery. Below 20%, devices enter power-saving mode. Below 10%, devices send critical alerts.",
    "answer": "20%"
