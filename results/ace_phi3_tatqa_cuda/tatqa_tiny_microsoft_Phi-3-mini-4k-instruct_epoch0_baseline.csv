microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct,tatqa_tiny,finance,baseline,tatqa_2,25500,"To calculate the net profit after tax, follow these steps:


1. Calculate the taxable income by subtracting expenses from revenue.

   Taxable Income = Revenue - Expenses

   Taxable Income = $50,000 - $20,000

   Taxable Income = $30,000


2. Calculate the tax by applying the tax rate to the taxable income.

   Tax = Taxable Income * Tax Rate

   Tax = $30,000 * 15%

   Tax = $4,500


3. Calculate the net profit after tax by subtracting the tax from the taxable income.

   Net Profit After Tax = Taxable Income - Tax

   Net Profit After Tax = $30,000 - $4,500

   Net Profit After Tax = $25,500


The net profit after tax for Company XYZ is $25,500.

microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct,tatqa_tiny,finance,baseline,tatqa_3,40,"To find the profit margin percentage, we first need to calculate the profit by subtracting expenses from revenue:

Profit = Revenue - Expenses
Profit = $200,000 - $120,000
Profit = $80,000

Now we calculate the profit margin percentage by dividing the profit by the revenue and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:

Profit Margin (%) = (Profit / Revenue) * 100
Profit Margin (%) = ($80,000 / $200,000) * 100
Profit Margin (%) = 0.4 * 100
Profit Margin (%) = 40%

The profit margin percentage for the company is 40%.",273597.59616851807,45,28,191,What is the profit margin percentage?,"A company earned $200,000 in revenue and had $120,000 in expenses.",0,0
